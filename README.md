# Automation-Playground

A locally hosted web application designed for QA engineers to safely practice and showcase end-to-end automation testing.  
This project was created to provide a realistic, self-contained environment for learning and training in test automation.

While I personally use **Playwright** and **Pytest**, professionals and learners can use any tools or frameworks they prefer to validate and explore the site’s functionality.

This project is a work in progress — new features and scenarios will be added gradually to expand testing coverage and complexity.
